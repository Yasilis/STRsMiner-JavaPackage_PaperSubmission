<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="left">
    This project was originally developed to identify shor tandem repeats (STRs). But now, after a few years, all kinks of tandem repeats (TRs) can b identified.
    So, we decided to change the name from STRsMiner to TRsMiner.
    This project is developed in java and R language in the Intellij IDEA IDE.
    The Java language is used for core functionality and major activites. While R language is used for statistical calculations.
    This package has been developed to retrieve, store, and analyze the data and information in the field of TRs.
    For running this package you need to connect a database of TRs and other neccessary data.
    It is possible to use the database that has been created in the paper "Tandem repeats ubiquitously flank and contribute to translation initiation sites" which is candidate for publish (Not Published).
    The generated database has been used to analyze data and TRs during the study and it is ailable in the “figshare” repository, with the identifier “10. 0 /m .figshare.15 052 ”
</p>
<p align="left">
    Another way is to create a database with this package. In this way, you need to create a empty database in the Mysql and connect it to the package.
    It is possible to use any king of database. But you need to config hibernate.cfg.xml config file separately.
